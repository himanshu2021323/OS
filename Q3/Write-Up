First we make directory Result and a text file output.txt in it. It will overwrite output.txt with a blank text file, if it already exists.
Then we read each line of input.txt in variable line, and split the line in x, y and operation,
and use case statement to identify the operation, and store the answer of each line in result variable,
it will also report any unknown operation. Then we will append the value of result variable in output.txt.
It will also print a confirmation message at the end.
